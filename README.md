# ACOUSTIQUE-PNR_BARONNIES-2020
Master 2 study : effect of artificial light and land use on biodiversity

With two different sampling protocols, we want to study **the effects of artificial light and land use on biodiversity at night** in the *Parc Naturel Régional des Baronnies provençales* (France, 26 - 05).

A potential description of changes in acoustic activity during a day or a week cannot be excluded.

## Two protocols

 - **PROTOCOLE_1_SM4**

*Effects of artificial light ("light pollution") emitted by the villages of the Park on biodiversity at night.*

*CONFIGURATION* :
- Sampling : 48 kHz
- recording duration : 3540 sec (59 min)
- sleep duration : 60 sec (1 min)
- cycle duration : 4 days and 4 nights

*DATA OBTAINED* :
- 3 687 files
- 2.51 Terabyte

In order to observe **the effects at night**, but also to describe **the effects of changing soundscape between night and day**.

 - **PROTOCOLE_2_AUDIOMOTH**

*Effects of land use on biodiversity, linked to artificial light.*

Random draw of 5 points in all types of land use in the municipality of Val-Buëch Méouge (France - 05) taking into account public or municipal properties.

*CONFIGURATION* :
- Sampling : 256 kHz
- recording duration : 300 sec (5 min)
- sleep duration : 600 sec (10 min)
- cycle duration : 6 nights (16:00-UTC / 06:00-UTC)

*DATA OBTAINED* :
- 10 081 files
- 1.55 Terabyte
