# ACOUSTIQUE-PNR_BARONNIES-2020
Master 2 study : effect of artificial light and land use on biodiversity

With two different sampling protocols, we want to study **the effects of artificial light and land use on biodiversity at night** in the *Parc Naturel Régional des Baronnies provençales* (France, 26 - 05).

A potential description of changes in acoustic activity during a day or a week cannot be excluded.

## Two protocols ##

 - **PROTOCOLE_1_SM4**

*Effects of artificial light ("light pollution") emitted by the villages of the Park on biodiversity at night.*

Recording at 48 kHz for 59 min with 1 min of rest. This cycle lasts 4 days and 4 nights in order to observe **the effects at night**, but also to describe **the effects of changing soundscape between night and day**.

 - **PROTOCOLE_2_AUDIOMOTH**

*Effects of land use on biodiversity, linked to artificial light.*

Random draw of 5 points in all types of land use in the municipality of Val-Buëch Méouge taking into account public or municipal properties.

Each point was sampled at 256 kHz for 300 sec (5 min) every 600 sec (10 min) for 6 nights.
